# subtitlebuilder

subtitlebuilder is a program designed to take a standard Microsoft Word Open XML Format Document file ```.docx``` and convert the text into subtitles using Photoshop Document files ```.psd``` generated by Adobe Photoshop.

## Dependencies
1. Adobe Photoshop
2. Java Runtime Environment 8+ (Recommended: JRE 11+)

## Use
1. Make sure subtitlebuilder.jar is in a self-contained directory with no other files or programs (the jar builds configuration files into the working directory)
2. Copy any Microsoft Word Open XML Format Document files ```.docx``` that you want to build subtitles for into the working directory created in step 1
3. Run subtitlebuilder.jar with path set to the parent directory of the jar (important!)
4. Select the path for the Adobe Photoshop executable
5. Select the parsing method (there are two methods: Expression or Line)
* The ```Expression``` method searches for "sentence-like" structures in the document and uses them as the basis to create subtitles
* The ```Line``` method takes each line and uses them as the basis to create subtitles
6. Select the path to an Adobe Photoshop Document file ```.psd``` to be used as a template (by default, subtitlebuilder uses the first text layer it finds to inject the subtitles)
7. Subtitles will then be created and exported to directories named after the file name of the Microsoft Word Open XML Format Document
